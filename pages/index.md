# ARIA-AT Report

## Test results

These test results are generated with [at-driver](https://github.com/bocoup/at-automation-experiment) and [aria-at-harness](https://github.com/bocoup/aria-at-harness).
Note that no assertions are currently run, only output is collected.
Therefore, it is not possible to assert any pass rate from the table below.
Each row has a link to a more detailed view for that test plan which shows the event log and output for each subtest.
